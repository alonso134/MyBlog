After coming back to MSU from Hong Kong I was pretty busy in the following spring semester since there are a lot of stuffs going on (credit transfer, exams, endless assignments..etc).\n\nAnyway, I'm back again, let's back to the business. Today I will talk about how to setup `git` on your own Ghost blog.\n\n#####Always setup a version control\nAfter successfully setting up Ghost blog, we might still need to make changes on `config`. It is **important** to have a version control to keep tracking your change and recover your original files from VPS failure or unexpected error occurs after you make changes. In most cases, we use `git` as your version control system since it is the most popular system used by developers. \n\n#####Deploy `git` to your blog\nIn this article we will use GitHub as an example.\n\nFirst of all, install `git` on your VPS:\n```\nsudo apt-get install git\n```\nWait till the installation is done, after you installed `git`, connect it to your GitHub account:\n```\ngit config --global user.name \"your name\"  \ngit config --global user.email \"your email\"\n```\nChange `your name` and `your email` to your GitHub username and email.\n\nTo connect, we need to add a `ssh key` to your GitHub account.\n```\nssh-keygen -t rsa -C \"your_email@example.com\"\n```\nAs the same from above, substitute `your_email@example.com` to the email you used on GitHub. When generating keys there will be an option for `ssh passphrase`, use any password you want or hit `Enter` to skip (use without password).\n\nWhen completed, under `/root/.ssh` there will be two files: `id_rsa.pub` and `id_rsa`, they are public key and private key respectively. \n\nOpen `id_rsa.pub` use `nano` or `vi`, copy **THE ENTIRE** content to your text editor.\n\nThen open your browser and login to GitHub, under **Settings**, click **SSH and GPG keys**, in the right panel, click **New SSH Key**, add any title and paste your key here.\n![SSH_Key](http://i.imgur.com/U2Q3lL4.png)\n\nTest your key on VPS, make sure it is working:\n```\nssh -T git@github.com\n```\nWhen you see the information below, means the key is successfully added.\n![succ_img](http://i.imgur.com/7lrSFpP.png)\n\nCreate a repository on GitHub with any name (i.e MyBlog), then back to VPS, go to the path of your Ghost blog and initialize `git`.\n```\ncd /var/www/ghost\ngit init\n```\nsometimes the path is located at home directory, then we use following instead:\n```\ncd ghost\ngit init\n```\nBind your local repository with your remote repository on GitHub:\n```\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:your_name/Blog_Name.git \n```\nSubstitute `your_name/Blog_Name.git` with your GitHub username and the name of your repository.\n\nAfter binding, add all files in your local repository into git and commit:\n```\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message\"\n```\nFlag `-m` means add message for this commit, `message` can be any message (don't forget quotes!).\n\nWhen you committed all of your work, push all of your changes to the remote repository:\n```\ngit push origin master\n```\n\nGo to your repository, make sure your changes has been submitted.\n\nGood to go! You have successfully setup `git` for your blog.","html":"<p>It's been a long time ago since I setup my blog and post the very first article.
